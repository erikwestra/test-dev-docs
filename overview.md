# Welcome to globaliD

globaliD is a San Francisco-based portable digital identity platform that is revolutionizing how we transact online. Our platform delivers a convenient onboarding and single sign-on experience, while empowering users to build digital reputations and to maintain consent-based control over their personal data. Our solution frees our partners from the burden of data storage and security, while still allowing them confidence in the validity of their users’ data and maintaining their compliance.

At this time, our product offerings include [globaliDConnect](FIXME), a secure user authentication and verification OAuth2 implementation, and [localiD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZtt_eZWe6A5KkyARVfKoYiIunkir2mIOQxr-uS1lyI/edit#heading=h.2j43ipai5j0l), a web-based identity management SDK.

# globaliDConnect

globaliDConnect is an OAuth2 protocol that mediates between your application and a user’s identity. It securely communicates your requirements for access, ensures that the user fulfils such requirements before permitting access, and allows users to explicitly consent to share personal data with you. Using globaliDConnect, users experience smooth, near-instant onboard or log in to your service by scanning a web QR code or by tapping a button on mobile.

globaliDConnect is a lightweight solution with heavyweight benefits, including:

 *   A complete onboarding solution that allows you to focus your on building your product instead of on data collection and compliance

 *   Fortifying your solution against hackers by doing away with usernames and passwords, thereby eliminating a common point of entry

 *   Protecting against fraud by permitting entry only to users who have successfully obtained the required attestations from the attesting agencies you trust

 *   A secure and seamless one-touch login experience that delights users and reduces friction to access

OpenID Connect support is coming soon.
